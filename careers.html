<h4> Ethical Hacker </h4>
<h2> Job Description - myworldofwork.co.uk</h2>
<div class="pic7" >
		<img src="pic7.jpg" width="200" height="150" >
	</div>
<p>You'd be employed to protect networks and computers from attacks from unethical hackers, who illegally access computers with the intention of accessing confidential information.
Delivering security testing using advanced software, you'd attempt to penetrate a company's systems in much the same way as a hacker - with the goal of uncovering any weak areas in the system. 
Conducting advanced penetration tests, you'd need to be familiar with the company's infrastructure and would have the ability to assess the risks to the organisation, inserting measures to control vulnerable areas.
By simulating breaches to network security and developing measures to lock down risks, you'd ensure that confidential, financial or reputational damage information wouldn't fall into the wrong hands.</p>

<p>Computers and technology are a part of everyday life and the tech industry in Scotland is thriving. To be ready for the workplace, students need to develop computing skills and an understanding of how computer systems work.
As a computing teacher you'd inspire and motivate young people to learn about computers, develop basic computing skills, learn how computers and computer systems work and help them design and build programmes.
You'd teach and support young people with different abilities and prepare them for their National Qualifications and Highers in this subject. You might also work in a college or learning centre.
There is national guidance for Curriculum for Excellence Technologies and National Qualifications, which you'd use when planning your teaching.</p>
